# 🚀 Employee Churn Prediction with PyCaret & BigQuery

Welcome to the **Employee Churn Analysis** project — a cutting-edge predictive modeling pipeline that leverages **Google BigQuery**, **PyCaret**, and **automated machine learning** to identify employees at risk of leaving the organization. Built for scalability, speed, and insights.

## 🔍 Objective

This project aims to empower HR analytics by forecasting employee attrition using historical workforce data. It answers critical business questions:

- Who is likely to churn?
- What are the driving factors?
- How can we proactively retain key talent?

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Google BigQuery** — Scalable cloud-based data warehousing
- **PyCaret** — Low-code machine learning library for quick experimentation
- **Python** — Scripting and orchestration
- **Jupyter Notebooks** — Interactive development environment

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   Connect seamlessly to enterprise-scale datasets hosted in BigQuery.

2. **Preprocessing & EDA**  
   Clean, visualize, and understand key patterns behind churn.

3. **Model Training**  
   Use PyCaret's classification module to benchmark dozens of ML models automatically.

4. **Model Selection & Evaluation**  
   Choose the top-performing model using accuracy, AUC, and confusion matrix.

5. **Insights Generation**  
   Feature importance and interpretability tools uncover the "why" behind attrition.

## 🧠 Algorithms Tested
